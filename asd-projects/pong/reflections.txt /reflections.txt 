User story/ gameplay
    There will be two playable players and each player will move their block/ paddle up and down to bounce the ball into each others goal.
        Will need border radius css to make rounded edges.
    Maybe the ball will bounce towards to left to start? Or it can just go randomly (like debugging execise) until one of the players can hit it. Or the game can start when left clicked
    The game will end once one player gets to 11 points
        Maybe there can be an end screen and a restart button if not too hard??
    There will need to be things like
        - "if player 1 gets to 11 points, end game" and "if player 2 gets to 11 points, end game".
        - "if ball hits player one's paddle, bounce either left or right" and "if ball hits player two's paddle, bounce either left or right"
        - "if ball hits boardHeight, bounce -top/up" and "if ball hits (number of the bottom), bounce top/up"
        - "if ball goes past (number of the side of player 1), player 2 gets 1 point" and "if ball goes past (number of the side of player 2), player 1 gets 1 point"
